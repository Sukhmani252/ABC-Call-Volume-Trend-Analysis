# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis

### **Problem Statement:**

A dataset is provided for inbound calls received by a company named ABC in past 23 days. The CX team's performance and customer interactions are to be analyzed so that the company can identify areas for improvement, optimize call routing, predict customer behavior, and enhance the overall customer experience.


### **Tools Used:**

Excel, Tableau

### **Insights:**

1. Average call duration is highest in morning between 10 to 11 but it is lowest in 12 to 1, might be agents are hanging up early due to midday hunger :)

2. Total number of calls coming in each time bucket shows that most active hours are morning hours between 10 to 12 and least active hours are in night.
  
3. Current abandon rate is approximately 30%. A new manpower plan is required to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.
    To achieve this, minimum number of required agents is calculated in each time bucket so that at least 90 calls should be answered out of 100.
    It is provided that an agent's total working hours is 9 hours out of which 1.5 goes into lunch and snacks.
    An agent remains occupied for only 60% of the total working hours.
    So, an agent works for 4.5 hours per day.

    Total time required to make answering rate 90% is then calculated with average no of calls coming and average duration for each call.
    It shows that total 57 agents are required for reducing abandon rate to 10%.

4. Now, company also require a manpower plan so that they can attend the customers calling in  night and also reduce the abandon rate to 10% for night calls.
   17 more agents will be required to answer the night calls.

5. Based on the number of calls coming, number of agents are distributed for every time bucket.
