# Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis

### **Problem Statement:**

A dataset is provided for inbound calls received by a company named ABC in the past 23 days. The CX team's performance and customer interactions are to be analyzed so that the company can identify areas for improvement, optimize call routing, predict customer behavior, and enhance the overall customer experience. The main task is to propose a new manpower plan to reduce the abandonment rate from 30% to 10%.

1. Average call duration is highest in the morning between 10 to 11 but it is lowest between 12 to 1, might be agents are hanging up early due to midday hunger :)

2. Total number of calls coming in each time bucket shows that the most active hours are morning hours between 10 to 12 and the least active hours are at night.
  
3. The current abandon rate is approximately 30%. A new manpower plan is required to reduce the abandonment rate to 10%.
    To achieve this, the minimum number of required agents is calculated in each time bucket so that at least 90 calls should be answered out of 100.
    It is provided that an agent's total working hours is 9 hours out of which 1.5 goes into lunch and snacks.
    An agent remains occupied for only 60% of the total working hours.
    So, an agent works for 4.5 hours per day.

    The total time required to make the answering rate of 90% is then calculated with the average no of calls coming and the average duration for each call.
    It shows that a total of 57 agents are required to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.

4. Now, the company also requires a manpower plan so that they can attend to the customers calling at night and also reduce the abandon rate to 10% for night calls.
   17 more agents will be required to answer the night calls.

5. Based on the number of calls coming, the number of agents is distributed for every time bucket.
